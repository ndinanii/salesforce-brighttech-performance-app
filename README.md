# BrightTech Solutions: Sales Performance "Mission Control"

This project democratizes insights by delivering a user-centric "mission control" app in Salesforce, surfacing actionable intelligence for the management team.

## 1. Business Challenge

Management was "flying blind." The data they needed existed within Salesforce, but it was difficult to access, aggregate, and interpret. They wasted time digging for information instead of taking action.

## 2. My Role & Strategic Solution

As a Junior Salesforce Strategist, my goal was to **democratize insights**. I designed a user-centric "mission control" center to surface actionable intelligence tailored specifically for the management team.

### Phase 1: Persona-Based Design

- **Business Goal:** Understood what "sales performance" truly meant to a manager and identified the 3-5 key metrics they needed to see daily.
- **Platform Strategy:** Designed a dedicated **Lightning App** rather than just a dashboard. This approach allowed for a fully controlled user experience, from navigation to a purpose-built home page.

### Phase 2: Configuration & User Experience (UX)

- **Business Goal:** Make the application intuitive, fast, and easy to use.
- **Platform Strategy:** Used the **Lightning App Builder** to construct the app with "clicks, not code," ensuring it is easy for future admins to maintain. The focus was on a clean UI, logical navigation, and a custom home page presenting the most critical charts "above the fold."

### Phase 3: Access & Adoption

- **Business Goal:** Ensure the *right* people see the *right* data, securely.
- **Platform Strategy:** Managed access through **Profiles and Permission Sets** as a key governance step to enforce data security and visibility rules.

## 3. Strategist's Note

> This solution demonstrates a customer-centric approach by treating the internal manager as the customer. By using standard reporting and the Lightning App Builder, we delivered a powerful, zero-code solution that empowers leaders and drives user adoption without incurring technical debt.
